# Alphabetize #
## Archived ##

This is an older project of mine from earlier in my coding career. I don't feel like making it private or deleting it, but this project does not necessarily reflect my current methodology as a developer. No further changes have been made. 

## About ##
Compares two strings, character by character. At the first pair of characters that aren't equal, it returns a 1 if the first string comes first, or a 2 if the second string comes first. If the trings are equal it returns a 0. Ignores case. 

## Usage ##
    Alphabetize("Hello", "world") // -> 1
    Alphabetize("world", "Hello") // -> 2
    Alphabetize("hello", "hello") // -> 0
    Alphabetize("hello", "Hello") // -> 0
